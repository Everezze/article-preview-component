## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Zooming on images to kinda "crop it" by enlarging the image, also the possibility to position it inside
it's container.
Second learning would be making triangles with only border properties.

Here are examples of both techniques:
```css
.img {
    width:120%;
    object-position: 10% 20px;
}
```
